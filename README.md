## Bingemasters

Bingemasters is an actor guessing game where images of an actor appear on the screen and players try to correctly identify the actor by either selecting a multiple choice option or correctly typing in the actor's name, depending on game format. The goal of the game is to record the highest streak, as the leaderboard tracks the highest streaks of all-time and ranks them in descending order. Do you have what is takes to become the ultimate Bingemaster?

## Motivation

The motivation for this game came from a similar game that my friends and I play on whatsApp. Someone on the chat will post two actor names and a year.  Whomever responds quickest with the correct movie both actors we're involved in gets to drop the next clue.  This game is an early prototype based on this idea.
